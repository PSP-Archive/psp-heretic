## What is PSP-Heretic?:

PSP-Heretic is a port of Raven Software's FPS game Heretic to Sony's Playstation Portable as well as Playstation Vita, using the Playstation Vita's PSP emulator (emulating a CFW is required for that). By porting the Chocolate Heretic engine, users are able to use this homebrew to play Heretic on Sony's Playstation Portable and Playstation Vita.

## Project Status:

This project is in a working state (the first release is R1).

## Usage

Place the files HERETIC.WAD (filename has to be LOWERCASE) into the same directory where the EBOOT.PBP and PSPHERETIC.WAD are located to use the program. The required configuration file and savegame files / directories will be created automatically within this program's directory.
